# Automaton-rs

*an interopt layer for the Automaton animation engine for creative coding*

|⚠️|This crate is currently work in progress and far from usable!|
|--|--|

This crate aims to provide a conformable method of interacting with [Automaton](https://github.com/0b5vr/automaton), an animation engine for creative coding developed by [0b5vr](https://github.com/0b5vr).

## Requirements

To use this library effectively, you will need the [Automaton electron app](https://github.com/0b5vr/automaton-electron). You can download a build of this tool in the releases secton [here](https://github.com/0b5vr/automaton-electron/releases).

This crate can (eventually) parse the projects generated by the editor, evaluate the animation curves and even communicate with the editor directly via websocket.
